## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
activity_data <- read.csv("activity.csv") 
date <- as.Date(activity_data$date)
activity_data$date <- date

```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
mean_total = sum(activity_data$steps, na.rm = TRUE) / (nrow(table(activity_data$date)))

daily_sums <- aggregate(.~date, data = activity_data, sum)
mean(daily_sums$steps)
median(daily_sums$steps)
hist(daily_sums$steps, breaks = 20)

```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
